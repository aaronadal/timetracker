# TimeTracker â€” A very basic time tracking app

## Getting started

In order to run this app locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed in your computer.

Once Docker is installed and running, you just have to execute the following commands:

1. Build the custom docker images with `make docker-build`.
2. Deploy the Docker Compose containers with `make start`.

That's all. Now the app is available in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
